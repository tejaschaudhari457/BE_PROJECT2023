Hardware Components:

Arduino Mega 2560
Where it's used: Central microcontroller for the entire system.
Why it's used: The Arduino Mega 2560 is the main control unit that will process data from all the sensors (TPMS, Smoke, Temperature, SOC). It has sufficient I/O pins for connecting various sensors and the MCP2515 CAN module for CAN communication. It acts as the hub for data collection and transmission.

MCP2515 CAN Bus Module
Where it's used: Interface between the Arduino Mega 2560 and the CAN bus network.
Why it's used: The MCP2515 is an external CAN controller that allows the Arduino Mega to communicate over the CAN bus. It converts the digital signals from the microcontroller into CAN protocol frames, which can be read by other CAN-enabled devices (e.g., car dashboard).

TPMS Sensors (Wireless RF or Bluetooth)
Where it's used: Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS).
Why it's used: The TPMS sensors monitor the pressure in each tire of the vehicle. Wireless modules like 433 MHz RF or Bluetooth can send pressure data to the Arduino Mega. This information is then sent over the CAN bus to other systems, such as the dashboard, for display.

MQ-2 / MQ-7 Smoke Sensor
Where it's used: Smoke detection in the battery compartment.
Why it's used: The MQ-2 or MQ-7 sensor detects the presence of smoke and hazardous gases. This is crucial for detecting fire or smoke near sensitive components like the battery. The data from the smoke sensor is sent to the Arduino Mega, which relays any danger over the CAN bus.

DS18B20 Temperature Sensor
Where it's used: Temperature monitoring of the battery compartment.
Why it's used: The DS18B20 is a digital temperature sensor that provides precise temperature readings. It is connected to the Arduino Mega and checks if the battery compartment is overheating. If the temperature exceeds a set threshold, it sends an alert over the CAN bus to the dashboard.

INA219/ACS712 Current/Voltage Sensor
Where it's used: State of Charge (SOC) monitoring for the battery.
Why it's used: The INA219 or ACS712 sensor measures the battery's voltage and current, allowing the system to determine its State of Charge (SOC). The Arduino Mega uses this data to monitor battery health and send the information to the CAN bus.

Car Dashboard (LCD/TFT Display)
Where it's used: Display of vehicle safety information.
Why it's used: The dashboard is the interface that shows critical information to the driver, such as tire pressure, temperature alerts, smoke detection warnings, and SOC. It reads the data transmitted over the CAN bus and visually displays the relevant data.

Power Supply
Where it's used: To power the Arduino and sensor modules.
Why it's used: A stable power supply is required for the Arduino Mega and sensor modules. Typically, this could be a 5V regulated power supply or car's 12V system using a DC-DC converter.


Software Components:


Arduino IDE
Where it's used: Programming environment for Arduino Mega 2560.
Why it's used: The Arduino IDE is the most common platform for writing and uploading code to Arduino boards. It supports C/C++ and has libraries for CAN communication, sensor integration, and general hardware control. You will use this to write the firmware for the Arduino Mega to read sensor data and communicate over the CAN bus.

MCP_CAN Library
Where it's used: To interface MCP2515 CAN Module with the Arduino Mega.
Why it's used: The MCP_CAN library is specifically designed to allow the Arduino to communicate with the MCP2515 CAN module. It helps you configure the CAN bus and send/receive CAN messages to and from other devices on the bus (such as the dashboard).

Sensor Libraries (for TPMS, MQ-2, DS18B20, INA219)
Where it's used: To interface with the sensors (TPMS, smoke, temperature, and SOC sensors).
Why it's used: Libraries such as the DallasTemperature library for DS18B20 and Adafruit INA219 library for INA219 make it easier to interface with sensors and get the data. These libraries handle the sensor-specific protocols and data acquisition, allowing you to focus on processing the data and sending it over CAN.

CAN Bus Protocol Code
Where it's used: To format and send data over the CAN bus.
Why it's used: You need to write custom code to package the sensor data into CAN protocol frames. This code will use the MCP_CAN library to send and receive messages. It will include the sensor readings (e.g., tire pressure, temperature, smoke levels) and send them to the CAN bus.

CAN Bus Monitor (Optional)
Where it's used: For debugging the CAN messages.
Why it's used: A CAN bus monitor (such as a PC-based CAN analyzer or software like CANoe) helps you observe the CAN bus traffic. Itâ€™s used for debugging and ensuring that messages are being transmitted correctly between the nodes (Arduino Mega, dashboard, etc.).

Dashboard Code (if applicable)
Where it's used: Display data on the car's dashboard.
Why it's used: If you are building a custom car dashboard display, you will need code to read CAN messages and display the data on an LCD/TFT screen. The dashboard code will interpret the data received via CAN bus and format it for easy reading by the driver.
