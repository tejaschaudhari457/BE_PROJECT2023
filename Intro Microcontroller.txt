1. TPMS Sensor Node Microcontroller:

Microcontroller: Arduino Mega 2560 (or Arduino Uno)

Reason for Choice: The Arduino Mega 2560 has multiple digital and analog pins, making it suitable for reading multiple sensor inputs (e.g., tire pressure sensors). It also has sufficient memory and processing power to handle CAN communication using an MCP2515 CAN Bus Module.
Explanation:
The TPMS sensors typically use pressure transducers that convert tire pressure into an analog or digital signal.
The Arduino Mega 2560 reads the sensor data via its analog or digital pins (depending on the type of sensor) and then sends the pressure data to the CAN bus via the MCP2515 CAN Bus Module.
The code for the TPMS sensor node initializes the CAN bus, sends the tire pressure data at regular intervals, and listens for any requests from the car dashboard.


2. Smoke Detection Node Microcontroller:

Microcontroller: Arduino Uno or Arduino Nano

Reason for Choice: The Arduino Uno or Arduino Nano is ideal for this node as it is small, affordable, and efficient for processing smoke detection signals. It can handle basic analog input (like from a smoke sensor) and CAN communication effectively.
Explanation:
The smoke sensor (e.g., MQ-7, MQ-2) outputs an analog signal based on the smoke or gas concentration.
The Arduino Uno reads the analog signal from the sensor via its analog input pin and sends the data to the MCP2515 CAN Bus Module to transmit the smoke detection status to the CAN bus.
The code processes the analog value, compares it to a threshold, and sends a warning message over the CAN bus if smoke is detected.


3. Temperature Sensor Node Microcontroller:

Microcontroller: Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano, or Arduino Mega 2560

Reason for Choice: The Arduino Uno and Arduino Nano are good choices for simple temperature sensors (e.g., DHT11, LM35, DS18B20). If you plan to add multiple sensors or need more processing power, the Arduino Mega 2560 would be suitable.
Explanation:
The temperature sensor (e.g., LM35 or DHT11) sends either an analog or digital signal that corresponds to the temperature.
The Arduino Uno or Nano reads the sensor value via its analog pin (for LM35) or digital pin (for DHT11) and then sends the temperature data over the CAN bus using the MCP2515 module.
The code reads the temperature value and formats it into a message to be sent over the CAN bus.


4. SOC Monitoring Node Microcontroller:

Microcontroller: Arduino Mega 2560 or Arduino Uno

Reason for Choice: For State of Charge (SOC) monitoring, the Arduino Mega 2560 is a good choice as it has more analog input pins to handle additional sensors (e.g., voltage dividers or battery sensors). The Arduino Uno is also suitable if fewer sensors are needed.
Explanation:
The SOC node monitors the vehicleâ€™s battery voltage using sensors like a voltage divider, current sensor, or an integrated battery management system (BMS).
The Arduino Mega 2560 reads the battery voltage through one of its analog pins and computes the SOC based on voltage levels.
The code processes the voltage reading, calculates the SOC, and sends it over the CAN bus for display or alert purposes.


5. Car Dashboard Microcontroller:

Microcontroller: Arduino Mega 2560 or Arduino Uno

Reason for Choice: The Arduino Mega 2560 is ideal for this node because it allows for multiple CAN bus interfaces, extra digital/analog inputs for additional sensors, and a large LCD screen. The Arduino Uno can be used for simpler setups with fewer connections.

Explanation:
The Car Dashboard node listens to the CAN bus for incoming messages from all the other sensor nodes (TPMS, smoke detector, temperature sensor, SOC).
The Arduino Mega 2560 uses the MCP2515 CAN Bus Module to receive messages from the CAN bus.
It processes the received data (such as tire pressure, temperature, smoke level, SOC) and displays it on a screen (e.g., LCD, OLED), triggering alerts if any values are outside the acceptable range.
The code listens for CAN messages, processes the incoming data, and updates the display accordingly.

CAN Bus Setup (For All Nodes):
Each of the microcontrollers uses the MCP2515 CAN Bus Module to communicate with other nodes via the CAN bus. The MCP2515 module is an external controller that interfaces with the microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Mega 2560, Uno, or Nano) via the SPI bus.

SPI Pins:
MISO (Master In Slave Out)
MOSI (Master Out Slave In)
SCK (Serial Clock)
CS (Chip Select)
Each microcontroller communicates with the MCP2515 module via SPI and sends or receives data on the CAN bus. The CAN bus allows all the nodes (sensor nodes and the dashboard node) to communicate with each other efficiently.

Conclusion:
For your automotive safety system using the CAN protocol, you can use the following microcontrollers:
TPMS Sensor Node: Arduino Mega 2560 or Arduino Uno (with pressure sensors)
Smoke Detection Node: Arduino Uno or Arduino Nano (with smoke sensors)
Temperature Sensor Node: Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano, or Arduino Mega 2560 (with temperature sensors)
SOC Monitoring Node: Arduino Mega 2560 or Arduino Uno (with battery voltage sensors)
Car Dashboard Node: Arduino Mega 2560 or Arduino Uno (with CAN Bus and display)
Each microcontroller handles the specific sensor and transmits data over the CAN bus to the Car Dashboard, which collects and displays the information. The choice of microcontroller depends on the complexity and number of sensors required for each node.
